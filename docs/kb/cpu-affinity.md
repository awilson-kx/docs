# CPU affinity




Kdb+ can be constrained to run on specific cores through the setting of CPU affinity.

Typically, you can set the CPU affinity for the shell you are in, and then processes started within that shell will inherit the affinity.

## Linux

<i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i> 
[Non-Uniform Access Memory (NUMA)](linux-production.md#non-uniform-access-memory-numa-hardware)


### Detecting NUMA

The following commands will show if NUMA is active.

```bash
$ grep NUMA=y /boot/config-`uname -r`
CONFIG_NUMA=y
CONFIG_AMD_NUMA=y
CONFIG_X86_64_ACPI_NUMA=y
CONFIG_ACPI_NUMA=y
```

Or test for the presence of NUMA maps.

```bash
$ find /proc -name numa_maps
/proc/12108/numa_maps
/proc/12109/task/12109/numa_maps
/proc/12109/numa_maps
...
```


### Q and NUMA

Until Linux kernels 3.x, q and NUMA did not work well together. 

When activating NUMA, substitute parameter settings according to the [recommendations for different Linux kernels](linux-production.md#non-uniform-access-memory-numa-hardware).


### Activating NUMA

When NUMA is 

-   **not active**, use the `taskset` command, e.g.<pre><code class="language-bash">$ taskset -c 0,1,2 q</code></pre>will run q on cores 0, 1 and 2. Or<pre><code class="language-bash">$ taskset -c 0,1,2 bash</code></pre>and then all processes started from within that new shell will automatically be restricted to those cores.
-   **active**, use `numactl` instead of `taskset`<pre><code class="language-bash">$ numactl --interleave=all --physcpubind=0,1,2 q</code></pre> and set<pre><code class="language-bash">$ echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/zone_reclaim_mode</code></pre>

You can change `zone_reclaim_mode` without restarting q.


### Other ways to limit resources

On Linux systems, administrators might prefer [cgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups) as a way of limiting resources.

On Unix systems, memory usage can be constrained using `ulimit`, e.g.<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ulimit -v 262144</code></pre>limits virtual address space to 256MB.


## Solaris

Use `psrset`

```bash
$ psrset -e 2 q
```

which will run q using processor set 2. Or, to start a shell restricted to those cores:

```bash
$ psrset -e 2 bash
```


## Windows

Start q.exe with the OS command `start` with the `/affinity` flag set

```dos
C> start /affinity 3 c:\q\w64\q.exe 
```

will run q on core 0 and 1.
